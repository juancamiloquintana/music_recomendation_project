# 🎵 Music Recommendation System: Project Overview

This project implements a **Music Recommendation System** that suggests songs to users based on **data analysis**, **user preferences**, and **audio feature similarity**.  
It leverages **content-based filtering**, **collaborative filtering**, and **machine learning models** to recommend songs users are likely to enjoy.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Exploration & Cleaning**
  - Preprocessing song metadata and user interaction data.
  - Handling missing values and normalization of features.

- **Feature Engineering**
  - Extraction of relevant song attributes such as tempo, energy, danceability, and valence.
  - Dimensionality reduction for efficient recommendation.

- **Recommendation Approaches**
  - **Content-Based Filtering:** Suggests similar songs based on feature similarity.
  - **Collaborative Filtering:** Uses user behavior and preferences to recommend tracks.
  - **Hybrid Approach:** Combines both techniques for improved accuracy.

- **Visualization**
  - Graphical representation of clusters, correlations, and recommendation results.

- **User Interaction**
  - Allows input of a song or artist to generate recommendations.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Spotify / Kaggle Music Dataset**
  - Includes metadata such as track name, artist, genre, and audio features.
  - Source: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/)
  - Split into **training**, **validation**, and **test** subsets for model evaluation.

## 🧠 Algorithms and Models

- **Cosine Similarity** for content-based filtering.  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for recommendation retrieval.  
- **Matrix Factorization / SVD** for collaborative filtering.  
- **Clustering (K-Means)** for feature grouping and pattern discovery.
